# digit-recognition-using-convolutional-neural-networks
This code is an example of recognition of diguts (handwritten or typed) using convolutional neural networks. The input is the image file and out is the recognised digit.


There are two codes:-
1) training and testing code
2) experiment code

This code can be run through command prompt by giving the command 
For- training code - ">> python filename"
For experiment code">> python filename.py imagename.py"

------------dataset used-----------
 data source - MNIST
 training samples- 60000
 testing samples -10000

The size of image accepted by the code is 28 X 28 pixels, therefore an image file with small dimensions will serve as ideal input. However, preprocessing is done to handle this issue.
